# Asteroids

Asteroids is a Star Wars themed remake of the classic game Asteroids, made in C++ with the SFML library. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and must navigate through space while avoiding asteroids and destroying enemy ships.

## Installation

To run this game on your computer, you will need to have SFML installed. You can download SFML [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

After installing SFML, you can download the source code for this game directly from this repository, or by cloning it using the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whazami/Asteroids.git
```
Once you have downloaded the source code, you can open the project in your preferred C++ IDE and compile it.

Alternatively, Windows users can test the game by running the Asteroids.exe file, located in the "bin" folder.

## How to Play

You can control your spaceship using the mouse and keyboard or a gamepad.

When using the mouse and keyboard, you can move your ship using WASD keys (or ZQSD on AZERTY) and fire with the left click.

When using a gamepad, the left joystick moves your ship, the right one rotates it and the right trigger (R2 on PlayStation controllers) fires.

The game ends if you run out of lives or if the countdown timer reaches zero.

## Troubleshooting

If you compile the source code and you get a black window but no error, you may have to modify the `assetsPath` constant located in `include/Utils/Constantes.h` to match your file tree.

The vibration of the gamepad can cause the game to freeze/crash if it is connected to the PC via a wired connection due to underpowering. You can deactivate it from the pause menu or connect your gamepad via bluetooth.
